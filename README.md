# e-commerce-application-follow-along

Key Features of the Project:

In this project, I will be building an E-Commerce app using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). Here is what I will be learning and working on:

REST API Creation: I will learn how to build scalable APIs to manage users, products, and orders, and get hands-on experience with backend development.

User Authentication: I will implement secure login and registration for users, which is a crucial part of any app that handles sensitive data.

Database Schema Design: I will explore MongoDB to design data models that are efficient and scalable for an e-commerce platform.

Backend Development: I will set up a server with Node.js and Express.js to handle requests, API routes, and interact with the database.

Frontend with React: I will use React to build dynamic, user-friendly interfaces, like product lists and shopping carts.


Milestone 2: 

Key Achievements
1. Project Structure:
Organized the project into frontend and backend directories for better maintainability.
Backend set up with Node.js to handle server-side logic, and the frontend set up with React to build the user interface.
2. React Frontend Setup:
Initialized a React app to manage the UI, allowing the e-commerce platform to be interactive.
3. Node.js Backend Setup:
Configured a basic Node.js server to lay the foundation for upcoming API integrations and user authentication.
4. Tailwind CSS Configuration:
Integrated Tailwind CSS for utility-first, responsive styling to enhance UI development speed.
5. Login Page Development:
Designed and built a functional Login Page with form validation and styling using Tailwind.


Milestone 3: 

In this milestone, we focused on building the foundation for the backend of our e-commerce application. The key objectives were to set up a server, connect it to a database, and establish a solid folder structure to keep our code organized.

Backend Folder Structure: We created a structured hierarchy for organizing backend code. This includes dedicated folders for routes, controllers, models, and middleware. This structure will make it easier to scale the project as more features are added in future milestones.

Server Setup: We initialized a Node.js server using the Express framework. The server is now configured to handle API requests, and it listens on a designated port for incoming requests.

Database Connection: We integrated MongoDB into the project to store and manage data. The server is now connected to MongoDB, enabling efficient data storage and retrieval.

Error Handling: Basic error-handling mechanisms were added to ensure that the server can respond with clear error messages for better debugging and user feedback.


Milestone 4: 

In Milestone 4, we focused on enhancing the backend by creating a User Model, setting up a User Controller, and enabling file uploads using Multer. These features are key to handling user data and media effectively in the e-commerce app.

User Model: We created a User Model, which defines how user data is stored in the database. This includes fields such as name, email, and password. We used MongoDB schemas to design the structure and validation rules for each user.

User Controller: The User Controller was developed to manage user-related requests, such as creating a new user and retrieving user information. This controller acts as the manager that handles data processing and communication between the frontend and the database.

File Uploads with Multer: We integrated Multer to enable file uploads, allowing users to upload images (e.g., profile pictures). Multer manages the file storage and ensures that the files are saved securely in the backend.


Milestone 5: 

In Milestone 5, we focused on building the Sign-Up Page for the frontend, where users can register by entering their details. This page includes essential fields such as name, email, and password, providing a clean and user-friendly interface for registration.

Frontend UI Development: We designed the Sign-Up Page using HTML and CSS. The page was structured to be intuitive, ensuring users can easily input their data to create an account.

Form Validation: Form validation was added to ensure that user inputs are accurate and meet the required format. For example, we validated the email format and enforced a minimum password length to enhance security. This step helps avoid errors and ensures only valid data is submitted to the backend.

UI/UX Enhancements: The design is simple yet effective, allowing users to smoothly enter their details. We focused on making the form clean and responsive, ensuring it works across devices.

Milestone 7: Login Endpoint üìù

Create a login endpoint to authenticate users. Users provide their email/username and password. The backend compares the entered password (hashed with bcrypt) to the stored password. If valid, a JWT token is generated and returned for subsequent requests.

Dependencies: bcryptjs, jsonwebtoken.

Test via POST /api/auth/login with email and password in the request body.

Response: Success with a token, or error for invalid credentials.
